<h1 align="left">Hello there👋🏾, I am Peterson</h1>
<h3 align="left"> A Full-Stack Developer | Mobile App Developer | Historian | 🖤</h3>




I’m a full-stack web and app developer who loves turning ideas into clean, functional, and sleek digital experiences.

I work with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Dart (Flutter), Python (Django), Node.js, MySQL and I’m always learning something new.

Right now, I’m building projects under my brand Peterson Muthomi Softwares, mixing tech, creativity, and a bit of dark-aesthetic energy.

I also study History at Maasai Mara University, which keeps me curious about how people and technology evolve together.

When I’m not coding, I’m probably lost in music — think Coldplay, Hozier, or Imagine Dragons.
