# Hello thereüëãüèæ, I am Peterson.

## Full-Stack Developer | Mobile App Developer | Historian




### About Me


I‚Äôm a developer who loves building things that *feel right*; smooth interfaces, meaningful logic, and digital experiences that leave an impression.  

I spend most of my time creating responsive websites and cross-platform apps under **Peterson Muthomi Softwares**, experimenting with design, functionality, and a bit of strategy. I like to think of code as both a craft and a language; one that connects ideas to real solutions.  

When I‚Äôm not in dev mode, I‚Äôm probably diving into history (I‚Äôm studying it at **Maasai Mara University**), sketching new app concepts, or getting lost in music from **Hozier, Imagine Dragons** or **The Lumineers**.  

I‚Äôm all about building with intention; clean, minimal, and quietly powerful.  
*Always learning. Always shipping.*
